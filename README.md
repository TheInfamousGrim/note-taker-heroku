## Description

The purpose of this application is to create a note taker that can be used to write and save notes. Express.js is used as the backend to help create the routes and will render,create and delete the note data from a JSON file. Finally the app is live and deployed to heroku.

The application is a backend application that can do the following:

- Render a homepage using routes
- Render a list of notes from the JSON file when the notes link is selected
- Create and save notes to the JSON file and have them persist on the application
- Render a selected note when the user selects the note they wish to see
- Delete a note when the user clicks on the delete icon

### User Story üë§

AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

### What did I Learn üè´

The big take away from this project was learning how to use Express.js to set up a server and how to use HTTP requests to update files, thus allowing data to persist on the page.

Other things I learned:

- How to use the nanoid to create unique identifiers
- How to use routes to render specific pages
- How to use APIs to access data
- How to use Insomnia Core to test APIs
- How to deploy an application to heroku
